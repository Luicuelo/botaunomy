## The Botanical Autonomy Mod!

I love Botania and find I want to do things from other mods with just Botania so 
I'm adding in bits and pieces here.  Most of these features will require the even 
resources so will be mid to late game Botania additions.

## Current Features

* Elven Avatar - upgraded avatar that can interact with the world. Think of 
    a more mystical, mana oriented autonomous activator.
* Rod of Will - Rod that the elven avatar can use to right-click on blocks.
* Rod of Toil - Rod that the elven avatar can use combined with tools to left click on blocks.
* You can use pickaxes,hoes,hatchet ... to break blocks.
* You can use tools , like shear on entities
* Can attack entities
* Mana can be transferred with a manatablet giving it to the avatar.
* Can use internal mana of the avatar with botania tools
* Can use rods like livingwood avatar.
* Animations when breaking blocks or using tools.
* You can insert tools to the avatar with a hopper.
* Emits a redstone pulse (value 1) when mana is consumed.
* Avatar is disabled when there is a strong redstone signal (14-15).
* MainHand Command prints the name of the element on the player's main hand.
