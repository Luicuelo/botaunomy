## The Botanical Autonomy Mod!

I love Botania and find I want to do things from other mods with just Botania so 
I'm adding in bits and pieces here.  Most of these features will require the even 
resources so will be mid to late game Botania additions.

## Current Features

* Dreamwood Avatar - upgraded avatar that can interact with the world. Think of 
    a more mystical, mana oriented autonomous activator.
* Rod of Will - Rod that the elven avatar can use to right-click on blocks.
* Rod of Toil - Rod that the elven avatar can use combined with tools to left click on blocks.
* You can use axes, picks, hoes ... to break blocks.
* You can use shear and tools on entities
* Can attack entities
* Animated when breaking blocks or using tools.
* You can insert tools to the avatar with a hopper.
* Redstone pulse value 1 when mana is consumed.
* Avatar is disabled when there is a strong redstone signal.
* MainHand Command says the name of the element of the player's main hand.
* Mana can be transferred to or form mana tablet on main hand of avatar.
